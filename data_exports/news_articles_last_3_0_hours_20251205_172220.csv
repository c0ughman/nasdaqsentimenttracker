8262,QLD,US weekly jobless claims drop to more than 3-year low,"STORY: The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week fell to its lowest level in more than three years, potentially giving the Federal Reserve a reason to hold interest rates steady when it meets next week.A report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial jobless claims fell by 27,000 last week, coming in well below economists’ expectations and painting a more robust picture of labor market conditions than other recent data.A day earlier, for instance, a report from private payroll processor ADP showed employers unexpectedly cut jobs in November, while economists had been expecting job gains.The ADP report pushed traders to price in about a 90% chance of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the conclusion of its policy meeting next week. But Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond, gives little credence to the ADP numbers.""The reason that ADP is being used is because we don't have the nonfarm payroll number, which is sort of the benchmark that everybody, including the Federal Reserve, uses to gauge the strength in the labor market. So ADP has kind of filled the gap. The problem with ADP is that it's a very noisy indicator. The reach of its survey data, the way that it collects it, the way it analyzes it is not nearly as comprehensive as the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

And I think it’s because even though we’re getting a lot of crosscurrents in the employment data, when you take a step back, the mosaic that emerges is that the labor market is indeed weakening. And I think the Fed is pretty laser focused on maintaining full employment without overheating the job market.”Markets are now pricing in an 87% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points next week, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.Stocks on the move Thursday included Amazon, which dragged on the S&P 500 with shares falling nearly one and a half percent.Shares of Salesforce climbed more than three and a half percent after the company raised its revenue and profit forecasts, anticipating demand for its artificial intelligence agent platform.And shares of Kroger fell more than four and a half percent after the supermarket chain narrowed its annual sales forecast and missed quarterly sales estimates.",Finnhub (Real-Time),https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=17452b136f7c44fcefbc8cfded61b40646ec5f7e1e7a04472b850e1ae09ee2c4,2025-12-04 23:28:45+00:00,2025-12-05 14:31:10.122107+00:00,d0c2837dbbdd7a2d0286375636409713,company,0.05,1.0,1.0,0.8,1.0,5.0,5.0,True,False
