    "summary": "STORY: President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang after a private discussion on chip export controls.“I did with Jensen [Huang], smart man.”Trump said that he had given a sense of where he stood on export controls and the types of chips that Nvidia can sell to China.“He knows, he knows very well. He's done an amazing job, Nvidia. Very good.”Huang's meeting with Trump comes as the administration considers whether to allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to China.Those are one generation behind its current flagship semiconductors.Huang also met lawmakers in Washington, where he told them that state-by-state U.S. regulations would slow down AI development.Nvidia also opposed a proposal that would require it to offer its chips to U.S. customers before obtaining licenses to sell them to \"countries of concern.\"The company argued the bill would restrict global competition in AI markets.Later in the day, at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Huang downplayed concerns that Nvidia chips are being smuggled in large volumes to countries where they are banned.“A GPU for AI centers, AI data centers. That GPU weighs two tons. It has one and a half million parts. It consumes 200,000 watts. It costs $3 million. Every so often somebody says, you know, 'these GPUs are being smuggled.' I really would love to see it. Not to mention you have to smuggle enough of them to fill a football field full of these things so that you could run it as an AI data center.”",

    "summary": "STORY: The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week fell to its lowest level in more than three years, potentially giving the Federal Reserve a reason to hold interest rates steady when it meets next week.A report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial jobless claims fell by 27,000 last week, coming in well below economists’ expectations and painting a more robust picture of labor market conditions than other recent data.A day earlier, for instance, a report from private payroll processor ADP showed employers unexpectedly cut jobs in November, while economists had been expecting job gains.The ADP report pushed traders to price in about a 90% chance of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the conclusion of its policy meeting next week. But Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond, gives little credence to the ADP numbers.\"The reason that ADP is being used is because we don't have the nonfarm payroll number, which is sort of the benchmark that everybody, including the Federal Reserve, uses to gauge the strength in the labor market. So ADP has kind of filled the gap. The problem with ADP is that it's a very noisy indicator. The reach of its survey data, the way that it collects it, the way it analyzes it is not nearly as comprehensive as the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So it's sort of a poor substitute.\"The closely watched nonfarm payrolls report for November, originally due on Friday, has been delayed because of the more than month-long government shutdown and will now be published on December 16 - after next week's Fed meeting.As many as five of the 12 voting policymakers on the central bank's rate-setting committee have voiced opposition to or skepticism about cutting rates further, while a core of three members of the Washington-based Board of Governors wants rates to fall.",

    "summary": "STORY: U.S stocks were little changed at the end of trading on Thursday, with the Dow closing slightly lower, the S&P 500 rising a tenth of one percent and the Nasdaq adding two tenths of a percent.Investors weighed a report from the Labor Department that showed initial jobless claims dropped to their lowest level in more than three years, potentially reducing the odds of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week.But in the absence of the November jobs report, which was delayed by the government shutdown, some economists said Fed officials could lean more on the ADP and Revelio Labs reports, which offered a weaker picture of the labor market.Chris Konstantinos of RiverFront Investment Group says he expects the Fed to cut rates next week.“So in terms of what I think the Fed will do, I do believe they’re going to cut interest rates again next week. And I think it’s because even though we’re getting a lot of crosscurrents in the employment data, when you take a step back, the mosaic that emerges is that the labor market is indeed weakening. And I think the Fed is pretty laser focused on maintaining full employment without overheating the job market.”Markets are now pricing in an 87% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points next week, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.Stocks on the move Thursday included Amazon, which dragged on the S&P 500 with shares falling nearly one and a half percent.Shares of Salesforce climbed more than three and a half percent after the company raised its revenue and profit forecasts, anticipating demand for its artificial intelligence agent platform.And shares of Kroger fell more than four and a half percent after the supermarket chain narrowed its annual sales forecast and missed quarterly sales estimates.",
