# Railway Cron Debugging Guide

## Current Status

Your script works perfectly locally. The issue is Railway's cron configuration.

## Why the Infinite Loop is Different

You're right to question this! The infinite loop approach:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Guaranteed to work, simple, you control the schedule
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Uses a running service 24/7 (costs more resources)

The `railway.json` cron approach:
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Only runs when scheduled, saves resources
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Doesn't seem to be working

## How to Debug Railway Cron

### Option 1: Check Railway Dashboard for Cron Feature

1. Go to your Django service in Railway
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Look for sections named:
   - "Cron Schedules"
   - "Scheduled Tasks"
   - "Deployments" (might have cron config)

**If you see these**, you can configure cron directly in the dashboard instead of railway.json.

### Option 2: Check if railway.json is Being Read

Add this to your railway.json temporarily to see if it's being read:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "startCommand": "echo 'RAILWAY.JSON IS BEING READ' && gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT",
    "cron": [
      {
        "name": "nasdaq-sentiment-analysis",
        "schedule": "*/5 * * * *",
        "command": "python manage.py run_nasdaq_sentiment --once"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you see "RAILWAY.JSON IS BEING READ" in the logs, then the file is being used.

### Option 3: Contact Railway Support

Railway's cron feature might be:
- Not available on all plans
- Not working as documented
- Requires different setup

You can ask Railway support directly via their Discord or support chat.

## Recommended Immediate Solution

Since you need this working NOW, here's what I recommend:

### Use the Separate Cron Service (But Smarter)

Instead of an infinite loop, create a **proper cron service** using Railway's service templates:

1. **Delete the infinite loop service** if you created it
2. **Create a new service** ‚Üí "Empty Service"
3. **Settings**:
   - Connect to GitHub repo
   - Root directory: `backend`
   - **Start Command**:
     ```bash
     python manage.py run_nasdaq_sentiment --once
     ```
   - **Restart Policy**: "Never" (so it exits after running)
4. **Add all environment variables**
5. **Use Railway's built-in scheduling** (if available in UI)

OR

Create a simple wrapper script that Railway can schedule better:

**Create `backend/run_cron.sh`:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    echo "Running sentiment analysis at $(date)"
    python manage.py run_nasdaq_sentiment --once
    EXIT_CODE=$?
    echo "Exit code: $EXIT_CODE"
    echo "Waiting 5 minutes..."
    sleep 300
done
```

Then set Railway start command to: `bash run_cron.sh`

## Summary

The issue isn't your code - it's Railway's cron configuration not working as expected.

**Best next steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Use separate service with sleep loop (works but uses more resources)
2. üîç Check Railway dashboard for native cron UI
3. üí¨ Ask Railway support why railway.json cron isn't working

Which would you prefer to do?
