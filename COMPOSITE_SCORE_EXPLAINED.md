## üèóÔ∏è **How It's Calculated**

### **Step 1: Individual Article Scoring**

For EACH article, we calculate an **article score** using 5 components:

```python
article_score = (
    base_sentiment      √ó 0.50 √ó 100 +  # 50% weight
    (surprise_factor-1) √ó 0.20 √ó 50  +  # 20% weight
    novelty_score       √ó 0.15 √ó 30  +  # 15% weight
    source_credibility  √ó 0.10 √ó 20  +  # 10% weight
    recency_weight      √ó 0.05 √ó 20     #  5% weight
)
```

## üìà **The 5 Components Explained**

### **1. Base Sentiment** (50% weight)
**What**: Core sentiment from FinBERT AI model
**How**: Analyzes headline + summary using financial language model
**Range**: -1.0 to +1.0
**Example**:
```
Headline: "Apple reports record earnings, stock surges"
Base Sentiment: +0.85 (very positive)

Headline: "Tesla faces production delays amid supply issues"
Base Sentiment: -0.45 (negative)
```

**Calculation**:
- FinBERT returns: `{positive: 0.92, negative: 0.03, neutral: 0.05}`
- Score = positive - negative = 0.92 - 0.03 = **+0.89**

---

### **2. Surprise Factor** (20% weight)
**What**: Measures if news is unexpected/surprising
**How**: Keyword detection for surprise words
**Range**: 0.8 to 1.5 (1.0 = normal)
**Keywords**: "unexpected", "surprise", "shock", "surge", "plunge", "soar", "crash"

**Example**:
```
"Apple SURGES after UNEXPECTED earnings beat"
‚Üí Surprise Factor: 1.5 (very surprising)

"Apple reports quarterly earnings"
‚Üí Surprise Factor: 1.0 (normal)
```

**Impact**: Surprising news gets amplified (positive or negative)

---

### **3. Novelty Score** (15% weight)
**What**: Is this article new or already seen?
**How**: Checks if article hash exists in database
**Range**: 0.2 to 1.0

**Calculation**:
```python
if article_hash in database:
    novelty = 0.2  # Old news, less important
else:
    novelty = 1.0  # Brand new, full weight
```

**Example**:
```
First time seeing article: 1.0
Already analyzed: 0.2 (discounted 80%)
```

**Why**: Old news shouldn't keep affecting sentiment

---

### **4. Source Credibility** (10% weight)
**What**: How trustworthy is the news source?
**How**: Pre-defined ratings for major sources
**Range**: 0.3 to 1.0

**Source Ratings**:
```python
'Reuters': 1.0,
'Bloomberg': 1.0,
'Wall Street Journal': 0.95,
'Financial Times': 0.95,
'CNBC': 0.85,
'MarketWatch': 0.80,
'Yahoo Finance': 0.75,
'Seeking Alpha': 0.70,
'Unknown': 0.50
```

**Example**:
```
Bloomberg article: 1.0 (most credible)
Random blog: 0.5 (less credible)
```

---

### **5. Recency Weight** (5% weight)
**What**: How recent is the article?
**How**: Time decay based on article age
**Range**: 0.5 to 1.0

**Calculation**:
```python
hours_old = (now - published_time) / 3600

if hours_old < 1:
    recency = 1.0      # Very fresh
elif hours_old < 6:
    recency = 0.9      # Recent
elif hours_old < 12:
    recency = 0.8      # Somewhat recent
elif hours_old < 24:
    recency = 0.7      # Today
else:
    recency = 0.5      # Older
```

**Example**:
```
Published 30 minutes ago: 1.0
Published 8 hours ago: 0.8
Published yesterday: 0.7
```

## üî¢ **Example Calculation**

### **Article: "Apple announces record iPhone sales"**

**Component Values**:
- Base Sentiment: +0.75 (positive)
- Surprise Factor: 1.2 (somewhat surprising)
- Novelty: 1.0 (brand new)
- Source Credibility: 1.0 (Bloomberg)
- Recency: 1.0 (just published)

**Calculation**:
```
article_score = 
    0.75 √ó 0.50 √ó 100 +     # Base: 37.5
    (1.2-1) √ó 0.20 √ó 50 +   # Surprise: 2.0
    1.0 √ó 0.15 √ó 30 +       # Novelty: 4.5
    1.0 √ó 0.10 √ó 20 +       # Credibility: 2.0
    1.0 √ó 0.05 √ó 20         # Recency: 1.0
    
= 37.5 + 2.0 + 4.5 + 2.0 + 1.0
= +47.0
```

**This article contributes +47.0 to the sentiment!**

---

## üìä **Step 2: Ticker-Level Aggregation**

### **For Each Stock (e.g., AAPL):**

1. **Analyze top 10 articles** for that stock
2. **Average their scores**:
   ```
   AAPL articles: [+47.0, +32.5, -12.0, +55.0, +28.0, ...]
   Average: +35.0
   ```

3. **Apply market cap weight**:
   ```
   AAPL weight: 14.3%
   Weighted contribution: +35.0 √ó 0.143 = +5.0
   ```

### **Current Example (from your logs)**:
```
AAPL (14.3% weight):
  Sentiment: +2.75
  Contribution: +0.39 (2.75 √ó 0.143)

MSFT (12.5% weight):
  Sentiment: +7.00
  Contribution: +0.88 (7.00 √ó 0.125)

NVDA (10.1% weight):
  Sentiment: +5.28
  Contribution: +0.54 (5.28 √ó 0.101)
```

## üéØ **Step 3: Final Composite Score**

### **Formula**:
```
Final Score = 
    Company News Sentiment √ó 70% +
    Market News Sentiment √ó 30%
```

### **Your Current Breakdown**:
```
Company News: +8.30
  ‚Üí Weighted: +8.30 √ó 0.70 = +5.81

Market News: +5.79
  ‚Üí Weighted: +5.79 √ó 0.30 = +1.74

Final Composite: +5.81 + 1.74 = +7.55
```
